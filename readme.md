# Building an NLP-Based Chatbot for College Website

## Overview

The goal is to build an NLP-based chatbot for the college website that utilizes all available college website data to assist students and teachers.

---

## Problems Arise in Our College

- **No proper use of sharing notice:** Important notices are not effectively communicated.
- **Student FAQs:** Students need someone to answer all their frequently asked questions.
- **Academic Pressure:** Heavy workload, calendars are not followed on time.
- **Notice Comprehension:** Some students can understand notices published on the website, but others have difficulties.
- **Mental Health:** Students often feel alone; mental health struggles are rising, and access to counseling is limited in large colleges.

---

## Solutions

- **Mentorship:** Students can find mentors through chatbot suggestions.
- **Support:** The chatbot provides support on resources, exams, and connections to student councils.
- **Career Guidance:** Answers career FAQs and suggests popular internships provided by the college.

## Project Plan

### 1. Define Chatbot Scope and Use Cases

- **For Students:** Answer FAQs, guide on admissions, provide course info, exam schedules, campus events, hostel info, support tickets, etc.
- **For Teachers:** Academic calendars, class schedules, leave management, notices, department contact info, etc.

### 2. Data Collection

- **Website Scraping:** Use tools like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy (Python) to extract relevant data (announcements, FAQs, contact info, syllabi, etc.).
- **Documents & PDFs:** Extract data from downloadable PDFs using PyPDF2, pdfplumber.
- **Databases/APIs:** Connect to any APIs or databases provided by the college for structured data.
- **Manual Input:** Manually input any unstructured or missing data, or request it from administration.

### 3. Data Preprocessing

- **Clean & Normalize:** Remove HTML tags, fix encoding, normalize text.
- **Indexing:** Store data in a searchable format (Elasticsearch, SQLite, or CSV/JSON for small projects).

### 4. NLP Model Selection

- **Rule-Based:** For simple Q&A (Rasa NLU, Dialogflow’s intent/entity matching).
- **Retrieval-Based:** Use models like BERT or OpenAI’s embeddings to match user queries to existing answers/data.
- **Generative:** For bots that generate answers (OpenAI GPT, Google Bard, Llama 2, etc.) — ensure privacy and appropriateness.

### 5. Chatbot Framework

- **Open Source:** Rasa, Botpress, ChatterBot.
- **Cloud-Based:** Dialogflow (Google), Microsoft Bot Framework, Amazon Lex.
- **Custom:** Flask/Django backend with NLP pipeline.

### 6. Integration with Website

- **Frontend Widget:** Use tools like Botpress Webchat, Kommunicate, or build a custom React/Vue/JS chat widget.
- **Backend API:** Expose the chatbot backend via REST API to the frontend.

### 7. Continuous Training and Feedback

- **User Feedback:** Allow users to rate answers for improvement.
- **Active Learning:** Regularly update dataset with new queries and answers.

### 8. Security & Privacy

- **GDPR/FERPA Compliance:** Protect student/teacher data.
- **Authentication:** For sensitive queries, require login (for teachers, admin, etc.).

## Sample Architecture

```
User (student/teacher)
         │
   Website Chat Widget
         │
   Chatbot Backend (API)
         │
   NLP + Data Layer
  (Intent Recognition, Document Search)
         │
   College Website Data (Scraped/Indexed)
```

---

## Sample Tech Stack

- **Scraping/ETL:** Python (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, pdfplumber)
- **NLP:** HuggingFace Transformers, spaCy, Rasa NLU, OpenAI API
- **Backend:** Python (Flask, Django), Node.js
- **Frontend:** React, Vue.js, or simple JS embedded widget
- **Database:** SQLite, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch
- **Deployment:** Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean, or your college server

## Example: How to Start in Python

```python
# Example: Simple Q&A chatbot with Rasa NLU
from rasa.nlu.model import Interpreter

interpreter = Interpreter.load('./models/nlu-model')
print(interpreter.parse("What is the last date for admission?"))
```

```python
# Example: Web scraping with BeautifulSoup
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "https://yourcollege.edu/faq"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
faqs = soup.find_all('div', class_='faq')
```

## Next Steps

1. List the main website URLs and data sources you want to use.
2. Define a set of core questions/tasks for students and teachers.
3. Decide on rule-based vs. ML-based chatbot (based on scope/resources).
4. Prototype the scraper and NLP pipeline.
5. Test with real users and iterate.
